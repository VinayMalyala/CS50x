**Custom Calculator: Blending Functionality and Creativity**

The Custom Calculator, born from the depths of the CS50 final project, emerges as a symbol of the harmonious marriage between practicality and innovation in the realm of software engineering. At its core, this digital tool serves a simple yet indispensable purpose: to facilitate basic arithmetic computations in a manner that is both intuitive and user-friendly. Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, the calculator's sleek interface is a testament to the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the trinity of web development technologies.

HTML lays the foundation upon which the Custom Calculator stands, defining the structural framework that organizes its components. From the buttons for numeric input to the display area where calculations unfold, HTML structures the calculator's interface with clarity and precision. Each element finds its place within the hierarchy, creating a cohesive user experience that is both intuitive and visually appealing.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) lend an aesthetic touch to the calculator's interface, transforming raw HTML into a polished and engaging visual experience. Through the judicious application of styles and visual enhancements, CSS breathes life into the interface, imbuing it with vibrancy and personality. Buttons adorned with gradient fills beckon users to interact, while subtle animations add a touch of dynamism to the overall design. The marriage of form and function is evident in every pixel, as CSS elevates the calculator from a mere tool to a work of digital art.

Meanwhile, JavaScript emerges as the silent force driving the calculator's logic and interactivity. As users input numbers and execute operations, JavaScript springs into action, orchestrating the behind-the-scenes magic that powers the calculator's functionality. Through event handling and DOM manipulation, JavaScript ensures that user interactions are met with instantaneous feedback, creating a seamless and intuitive user experience. Whether it's performing arithmetic calculations or toggling between themes, JavaScript empowers users to engage with the calculator effortlessly, without missing a beat.

At the heart of the Custom Calculator lies its core functionality: the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease and precision. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—these fundamental operations form the building blocks of mathematical computation, and the calculator handles them with grace and efficiency. With each keystroke or tap, users wield the power to input numbers and execute operations, unlocking a world of mathematical possibilities at their fingertips.

But the Custom Calculator is more than just a tool for number crunching; it is a testament to customization and personalization. One of its standout features is its dual-theme support, offering users the flexibility to switch between light and dark modes at their discretion. Whether it's the crisp clarity of a light theme or the subdued elegance of a dark theme, the calculator adapts seamlessly to suit users' preferences and ambient lighting conditions, ensuring optimal readability and comfort.

In addition to its core functionality and customizable themes, the Custom Calculator offers a range of features designed to enhance usability and convenience. A clear button provides users with the means to reset calculations and start afresh—a simple yet invaluable tool for error correction and iterative problem-solving. Standard numeric keys from 0 to 9, alongside operation keys such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), ensure comprehensive support for a wide range of mathematical expressions. And when it's time to compute results, the equals (=) button stands ready to deliver precise answers with a single press—a testament to the calculator's efficiency and reliability.

In conclusion, the Custom Calculator embodies the spirit of innovation and craftsmanship that defines the CS50 experience. From its sleek interface to its robust functionality, every aspect of the calculator reflects a commitment to excellence and attention to detail. With its seamless blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the calculator serves as a shining example of what can be achieved through the power of code. Whether it's solving complex equations or simply performing everyday calculations, users can rely on the Custom Calculator to deliver a seamless and satisfying mathematical experience, one keystroke at a time.

Overall, the Custom Calculator provides a simple yet functional tool for performing calculations with a customizable visual theme.
