The audio aura of a listener can be characterized by the top 100 songs they listened to in 2018. This can be done by calculating the average frequency, amplitude, and timbre of the songs. The audio aura can also be characterized by the emotions that the songs evoke. This can be done by using a sentiment analysis algorithm to analyze the lyrics of the songs.

There are a few reasons why the way I've calculated the audio aura might not be very representative of the listener. First, the top 100 songs of a listener may not be a representative sample of their overall listening history. For example, a listener may have listened to a lot of songs in a particular genre that are not included in the top 100. Second, the audio aura of a listener may change over time. For example, a listener may have different preferences for music in different stages of their life.

There are a few better ways to calculate the audio aura of a listener. One way would be to use a larger sample of the listener's listening history. Another way would be to use a more sophisticated algorithm to calculate the audio aura. Finally, it would be helpful to take into account the listener's emotions when calculating the audio aura.
